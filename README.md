# Logic sim

This projects objective is to produce a visually pleasing and interactive simulation of logical circuits, from very simple , to full computers.

It works using a grid based system where signals propagate 1 cell per timestep.

#GUI

The custom gui used in this project is also being developed simultaneously.
Eventually this gui could also replace dat.gui in 2D_weather_sandbox.

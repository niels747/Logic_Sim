# Logic sim

This projects objective is to produce a visually pleasing and interactive simulation of logical circuits, from very simple , to full computers.

It works using a grid based system where signals can only propagate 1 cell per timestep.
Basic wire cells propagate signals in all 4 directions, while bridge cells allow vertical and horizontal signals to remain seperate.

Logic gates with 1, 2 or 3 iputs can be used

A 4-bit full adder using compact sum and carry gates, calculating 6 + 3 = 9

Compact vertical horizontal interconnects can be used to create compact decoders, such as BCD and 7 segment decoders

#GUI

The custom gui used in this project is also being developed simultaneously.
Eventually this gui could also replace dat.gui in 2D_weather_sandbox.
